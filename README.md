# Maternal & Child Health Equity Analysis

**Analyzing the relationship between federal health program funding and community health outcomes**

## Overview

This project examines Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) grant allocations across the United States, with a particular focus on mental health programs and their correlation with regional health outcomes. Using data from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) with CDC public health data, I explored funding patterns, equity issues, and potential impacts on maternal and child health metrics.

**Why this matters:** Mental health support during pregnancy and early childhood can significantly impact long-term health outcomes, yet access to these programs varies widely by geography and demographics.

## Key Questions

1. How are mental health-focused grants distributed geographically?
2. What's the relationship between program funding levels and local health outcomes?
3. Can we identify underserved regions that might benefit from increased funding?
4. Do specific program types correlate with better maternal/child health metrics?
